## üëÅÔ∏èProject Overview


The House Price Prediction project is designed to provide accurate property price estimates using machine learning models. It comprises the following key components:

1. Machine Learning Model:

Develop a robust machine learning model for predicting house prices.
Train the model with a diverse dataset, considering factors such as property location, size, bedrooms, and amenities.
Ensure thorough data preprocessing, including handling missing values and outlier detection.

2. User-Friendly Web Application:

Create an intuitive web application for instant house price predictions.
Allow users to input property details for real-time price estimates.
Prioritize transparent predictions, helping users understand the impact of various factors on the estimated price.
Ensure scalability to accommodate a wide range of users.
This project empowers homebuyers and sellers with data-driven insights for well-informed real estate decisions.
